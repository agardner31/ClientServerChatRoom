Hello TA. I hope you are having a wonderful day.
This chat room was written in C to run on the newest version of Ubuntu 20.04.2.

Instructions to run my code:

Navigate to the folder with chat files in your directory and run 'make' in your terminal/command prompt to compile the code
To start the server, run './chatserver' on your terminal/command prompt.
To join the chat room as a new user and connect to the server, open a new terminal and run './chatclient -username <username> -password <password>
Type any messages you want to send as a user and press enter to send. Special 'emoji' messages will be sent as the text translation.
Messages sent will be logged by the server.
Type 'Exit' to end connection and leave chat room.

To get rid of compiled files for any reason, use 'make clean' command.
To shut down server use Ctrl C.
